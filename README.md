# GANimation: Facial animation from images
[ [original Paper]](https://rdcu.be/bPuaJ) 
In this work we try to replicate a novel GAN conditioning scheme, proposed by thepaper above, based on Action Units (AU) annotations, which describe in a continuous manifold the anatomical facial movements defining a human expression. Our approach permits controlling the magnitude of activation of each AU and combine several of them. For more information please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09251).



## Prerequisites
- Install requirements.txt (Detailed packages and version required are listed)

## Data Preparation
The code requires a directory containing the following files:
- `imgs/`: folder with all image
- `aus_openface.pkl`: dictionary containing the images action units.
- `train_ids.csv`: file containing the images names to be used to train.
- `test_ids.csv`: file containing the images names to be used to test.

An example of this directory is shown in `celeA/`.



## Run
vscode/launch.json: code specifies train and test options
